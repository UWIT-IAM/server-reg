<!-- Server-Reg pubcookie Help top text -->


The pubcookie server registration website allows you to register
new web servers for use with pubcookie at the University of Washington.

Installation of pubcookie&nbsp;3.x requires that you:

<p>
<ol>
<li>
Retrieve and store the login server's granting certificate.  You
can use pubcookie's keyclient for this, or use this page:
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li><a href=?req=gcrt>Get the granting certificate</a>
 </ul>
<p>

<li>
Retrieve and store an encryption key file.  This file is unique
to your domain, and is retrieved with pubcookie's keyclient
utility.  In order to run keyclient your domain must first be
registered with the login server.  Use the registration pages
for that.
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li><a href=?req=form>Register a server</a>
 </ul>
<p>


</ol>
