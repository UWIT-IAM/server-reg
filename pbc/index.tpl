The University of Washington maintains this
Certificate Authority (CA) 
to facilitate secure communincation between clients and
services at the University by
issuing IETF X509 client and server certificates
to authorized applications.

These certificates allow the applications to positively
identify themselves and authenticate their peers
in a communications network.

 <p>

It is expected that a majority of the University
community will install the UW Services CA certificate into their
browsers or email clients as a trusted certificate authority,
thereby allowing UW issued certificates to seamlessly and
securely authenticate UW web and email applications.
